# CMRx4DFlowReconDemo

This demo contains several Jupyter notebooks (`*.ipynb`) organized into the following parts:


### 1) Undersampling Demo

### 2) Compressed Sensing Reconstruction

### 3) Flow Variational Network (FlowVN) Reconstruction

### 4) PostProcessing Demo

### 5) Evaluation Demo

## Notes
- If you change parameters in earlier steps (e.g., undersampling rate), results in later steps will change accordingly.
